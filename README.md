# Expo CLI: Uncommon Build/Start Errors

This repository demonstrates a scenario where unexpected errors occur during the Expo build or start process.  These errors are often caused by version mismatches between the Expo CLI, various Expo modules (like `expo-camera`, `expo-location`, etc.), and the versions of those libraries you have installed in your project.

## Problem

The core issue is a lack of compatibility.  The project might depend on a specific version range for some packages, but the installed versions or Expo CLI itself might impose constraints that lead to errors that aren't immediately obvious.  Errors can range from cryptic messages to outright crashes during the build or start phase.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your `package.json` file and ensuring that all versions are compatible.  This may require:

1. **Updating Expo CLI:** Use `expo upgrade` to update to the latest version of the Expo CLI.
2. **Checking Package Versions:**  Review your project's `package.json` to see if any of the packages list incompatible versions or version ranges with your current Expo CLI or each other.
3. **Using npm-check-updates:** Run `ncu -u` to update your package versions to their latest compatible versions.  This will update `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
4. **Manually Updating:** If `ncu` doesn't resolve the issues, manually inspect the versions of the packages and update them to versions confirmed to be compatible with each other and your Expo CLI. After changes, run `npm install`.
5. **Cleaning and reinstalling:** Delete your `node_modules` folder, then reinstall packages with `npm install`. 
6. **Expo Prebuild:** If applicable to your project, try `expo prebuild`. This step can help to resolve issues by compiling the project's native modules before running.
